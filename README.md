# interactive_weather_map

<p>An interactive map where users can click on any location and get the current weather in that location. Users can also input a location into the search field and the map will move to that location and display the current weather at those coordinates.</p>

<p>The app uses a combination of the Google Maps API, Google Geocoding API, and the Open Weather Map API.</p>

<p>I restricted the Google API key to the url of the app so that it can't be fraudulently used and I hid the Open Weather Map API key using environment variables and a serverless LAMBDA function.</p>
